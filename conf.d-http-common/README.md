Common configuration loaded from http context from main nginx.conf

As a result, some files may be generated by separate applications
eg. file *map_user2port.conf* user port mapping.

To *http* section add:

`include conf.d-http-common/*.conf;`

Each option can be individually redefined from/in *server* context.
